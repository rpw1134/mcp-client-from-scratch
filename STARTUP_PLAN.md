# Application Startup and Architecture Plan

## Startup Sequence

1. **Redis Connection Establishment**
   - Connect to Redis database
   - Verify connection is healthy
   - Configure connection pool if needed

2. **Session Store Instantiation**
   - Initialize SessionStore with Redis connection
   - SessionStore manages conversation history
   - Handles session creation, retrieval, and updates

3. **Server Configuration Instantiation**
   - Load pre-configured MCP servers from `server_config.json`
   - Parse and validate server configurations
   - Initialize ServerConfig instance with loaded configurations

4. **Dynamic Server Management**
   - Support adding new MCP servers via API
   - Accept properly formatted server configuration objects
   - Validate and store new server configurations

## Data Persistence Strategy

### Short-term (Current)
- **Redis**: In-memory cache for active sessions and configurations
- Fast read/write for real-time operations

### Long-term (Future)
- **PostgreSQL or MongoDB**: Persistent data store
  - MongoDB recommended for document-based storage (sessions are JSON-like)
  - Write-through caching pattern:
    1. Write to persistent DB first
    2. Update Redis cache
    3. Ensures data durability
- **Data to persist**:
  - Session history
  - Server configurations
  - User preferences/settings

## API Design

### Purpose
- Extend OpenAI API capabilities with MCP server integration
- Project can be configured for specific use cases
- Expose as API for various applications

### Configuration Options
- Pre-configured: Load from `server_config.json` at startup
- Dynamic: Add/modify servers via API endpoints

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Support both pre-configured and dynamic server management
2. **Scalability**: Redis for fast access, persistent DB for durability
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new MCP servers and configurations
4. **Use-case specific**: Can be tailored and deployed for different scenarios
